ðŸ‘‹ Hi, you can call me @JensHennig, Jens or Ragingbear.

ðŸ˜„ I'm a former filmmaker and mediadesigner with the urge to get back into Tech and Coding.
I'm looking for a new challenge and want to develop my strengths further to become an amazing IT-Projectmanager some day.
Right now i'm just trying to catch up to 15years of developement since i finished my Computer Science Assistant in 2010.
I'm looking forward to learn a bunch of new stuff and connect with some awesome people!
